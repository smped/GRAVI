A set of treatment-specific `target` *oracle peaks* was defined for each condition by taking the peaks defined by merging all samples from each treatment group.
These were then compared to the individual replicates within each respective condition which passed the initial QC.
Oracle peaks which overlapped a peak in more than `r percent(config$peaks$qc$min_prop_reps)` of the *individual replicates passing QC*, were retained.

```{r tab-oracle-peak}
oracle_peaks %>%
  lapply(as.data.frame) %>%
  lapply(list) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "treat", values_to = "data") %>%
  mutate(
    detected_peaks = map_int(data, nrow),
    retained = data %>% lapply(dplyr::filter, keep) %>% map_int(nrow),
    `% retained` = percent(retained / detected_peaks, 0.1)
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(treat, detected_peaks, retained, `% retained`) %>%
  rename_all(str_sep_to_title) %>% 
  pander(
    justify = "lrrr",
    caption = glue(
      "Oracle peaks detected by merging samples within each treatment group.",
      "Peaks were only retained if detected in at least",
      "{percent(config$peaks$qc$min_prop_reps)} of the retained samples for each", "treatment group, as described above.",
      .sep = " "
    )
  )
```

### Consensus Peaks

In addition to the oracle peaks, a set of `r comma(length(consensus_peaks))` treatment-agnostic `r target` **consensus peaks** were defined.
Ranges were the union of any overlapping ranges identified in one or more sets of oracle peaks.

```{r plot-common-peaks, results = 'hide', echo = length(treat_levels) <= 3}

  vd <- oracle_peaks %>%

      function(x) {

## Data Export


```{r export}
all_out <- list(
  consensus_peaks = file.path(out_path, "consensus_peaks.bed"),
  oracle_peaks = file.path(out_path, "oracle_peaks.rds"),
  renv = file.path(
    here::here("output/envs"), 
    glue("{target}_macs2_summary.RData")
  )
) 
export(consensus_peaks, all_out$consensus_peaks)
oracle_peaks %>%
  lapply(subset, keep) %>%
  lapply(select, -keep) %>%
  GRangesList() %>%
  write_rds(all_out$oracle_peaks, compress = "gz")
save.image(all_out$renv)
```

During this workflow the following files were exported:

`r pander(lapply(all_out, str_extract, pattern = "output.+"))`

<button type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-sessioninfo" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#sessioninfo" style="display: block;">
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span> Session information
</button>
</p>
<div id="sessioninfo" class="collapse">
```{r session-info, echo=FALSE}
pander::pander(sessionInfo())
```
</div>
