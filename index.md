# Using the GRAVI Workflow

## Introduction

Gene Regulatory Analysis using Variable Inputs (GRAVI) is a snakemake workflow designed for the differential binding analysis and integration of multiple ChIP targets.
These can be distinct ChIP targets within the same biological sample, or the same ChIP target across multiple biological contexts.

The workflow requires aligned reads as `bam` files as the starting point for the workflow.
