## GRAVI data folder

This folder is the common recommendation for placing all data files.
The recommended structure is:

- Place alignments in a directory called `bam` or `aligned`. This can be customised in `config.yml`
- Place any external data in a directory call `external`. This is where the GTF, blacklist or any other files should be placed. Again, these paths can be customised using `config.yml`
