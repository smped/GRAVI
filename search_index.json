[["index.html", "GRAVI User Guide (v0.1.6) Chapter 1 Introduction", " GRAVI User Guide (v0.1.6) Stephen Pederson 2023-07-09 Chapter 1 Introduction This book is the primary documentation for running the GRAVI (Gene Regulatory Analysis using Variable Inputs) workflow. This workflow is managed using snakemake (&gt;v7.7) for running locally or on any HPC, and is designed to minimally take one ChIP target under at least two conditions. There is no theoretical upper limit to the number of ChIP targets which can be analysed, although the practicalities of interpretation will dictate this. Required additional inputs are: A gtf with gene, transcript and exon-level annotations. The workflow has been tested extensively with Gencode annotations and these are preferred. A blacklist should also be provided as a bed file. These can easily be obtained from here In addition to \\(\\geq 1\\) ChIP targets, optional input includes: Differential Expression results from a single RNA-Seq experiment as a tsv/csv Any type of genomic feature derived or obtained externally (*gtf) HiC Interactions (*.bedpe) Additional coverage tracks for visualisation, such as those produced by key histone marks (*bigwig) The GRAVI workflow itself will Annotate the genome using a custom, transcript-focussed approach Identify peaks using macs2 callpeak Perform differential binding analysis for each ChIP target &amp; requested comparisons Compare differential binding results across ChIP targets or samples (Pair-wise comparisons) Perform enrichment analyses at all steps of the workflow The primary output is a series of html pages generated from rmarkdown files, along with key figures and tables able to be shared amongst collaborators and incorporated directly into publications.

The workflow management software snakemake(Mölder et al. 2021) is used to run the complete workflow, giving the capacity to be run on local servers or HPC systems. The snakemake DAG (directed acyclic graph) of the workflow is always included in the compiled document, however a simplified version is presented below. Figure 2.1: Simplified DAG of the GRAVI workflow. Key steps are numbered and shown in black. Inputs are shown in blue, whilst key outputs are shown in coral. The workflow produces a series of HTML reports as a larger webpage, inspired by the excellent workflowr(Blischak, Carbonetto, and Stephens 2019) package but instead relying directly on rmarkdown::render_site()(Allaire et al. 2022). The compiled html pages will be placed in the docs directory, with all source rmarkdown files being placed in the analysis directory. Key additional outputs (e.g. bed/csv files) are placed in the output directory. The standardised directory layout is shown in Section 4.1. The complete R environment from every compiled HTML page is also saved in output/envs, however these are marked as temporary files by the workflow and will be deleted when removing temp output (snakemake --delete-temp-output --cores 1) 2.1 Annotation Setup Genomic Regions Defining genomic regions is a key part of the setup for analysis. Under the GRAVI workflow, a series of non-overlapping genomic regions are defined which characterise the most likely role/aspect for each specific region. As these will be unique to each Gencode build, and also include any optional RNA-Seq data, this step is performed for every experiment. This step follows the default process as defined in the function defineRegions() from the Bioconductor package extraChIPs Promoters: By default these are defined as -1500/+500bp from every distinct TSS. If promoters from two or more transcripts overlap, they are merged into a single promoter. These ranges can be easily changed to increase or decrease the size using the YAML as described in Section 5.3 Upstream Promoters: These are extended promoter regions up to 5kb upstream by default, which again can be changed to suit Exons are defined as any exon not overlapping a promoter or upstream promoter Introns are defined as any transcribed sequence not overlapping a promoter, upstream promoter or exon Intergenic Regions: are divided into two subsets, neither of which are permitted to overlap any previously defined regions Within 10kb of a gene. Again this distance is customisable Beyond 10kb of a gene. During the characterisation of all the above regions, mappings to associated genes and transcripts is retained and included in the subsequent GenomicRanges object. Other Steps Additional steps performed during preparation of the annotations are to ensure that all external features, treatment groups and defined genomic regions have colours assigned, which will then propagate through the workflow for consistency of visualisation. External features and/or HiC data is summarised if provided and the association between these datasets and defined genomic regions is also provided as part of the output. Greylisted regions are also determined and prepared for exclusion through the workflow, along with the provided blacklisted regions. 2.2 Peak Calling This section of the workflow uses macs2 callpeak(Zhang et al. 2008) with default parameters. Peaks are called on each individual sample and by merging samples within treatment groups for each provided ChIP target. One summary report will be produced each ChIP target specified in the target column of samples.tsv, which will assess all treatments within a ChIP target. Quality Assessment Basic QC statistics such as Library Size, Read Lengths, Total Detected Peaks and Fraction Of Reads In Peaks (FRIP) are provided in tabular and visual form. Plots showing sample-specific GC content and Cross Correlations are also provided to enable visual identification of any outlier samples which can be excluded manually, or handled in any other suitable manner. One feature of the GRAVI workflow is to compare between replicates within a treatment group to determine any low-quality samples. Taking the median number of peaks within a sample group (\\(np_i\\)), and sample with \\(&gt;N\\)-fold or \\(&lt;N\\)-fold \\(np_i\\) peaks will be marked as an outlier. By default, this is set to 10-fold using the parameter outlier_threshold (Section 5.1) and can be disabled by setting this parameter to .inf, which will be passed to R as the value \\(\\infty\\). Given that some ChIP targets may be cytoplasmic and yield zero peaks in some treatment groups, samples with zero peaks can also be allowed by setting allow_zero to be true. Results Individual Replicates: UpSet plots(Conway, Lex, and Gehlenborg 2017) of all samples are first produced to enable identification of any possible mislabelling. Venn Diagrams are then produced for all replicates within each treatment groups (if \\(n \\leq3\\)), or UpSet plots are produced for \\(n \\geq4\\) replicates to show consistency between replicates. Treatment Peaks: During this step of the workflow a set of treatment-specific peaks will be produced for each ChIP target. The set of peaks obtained by merging samples will be compared to all individual samples, and only those peaks identified in at least \\(100*p\\%\\) of the samples which passed QC will be included in the set of Treatment peaks. This parameter can be set in config.yml as the parameter min_prop_reps (Section 5.1) with the default of 0.5 indicating that peaks must be detected in 1 or more samples (if N = 2), two or more samples (if N = 3, 4) etc. Union Peaks: After defining the treatment-specific peaks, these are combined to define the set of union peaks. Treatment peaks are merged across conditions in an inclusive manner, such that the range of each union peak encompasses the entire region covered by all overlapping treatment peaks. Union peaks are then used as the ‘universe’ of peaks against which treatment-specific behaviours are compared. Peaks overlapping a blacklisted or greylisted region are excluded at all steps of the analysis. The final HTML report produced for each target will contain: A Venn Diagram showing the overlap in Union peaks and whether one or more Treatment peaks overlaps the Union peak. In the case of 4 or more treatments, an UpSet plot will be produced instead Distance to TSS plots as actual and cumulative distributions using union peaks. A pie chart describing the distribution of union peaks within the genomic regions defined previously Additional plots will be produced in the presence of external data The distribution of union peaks within external features will be shown if external features are provided The distribution of union peaks within external features and genomic regions will be shown if external features are provided Highly-ranked union and treatment-specific Treatment peaks are also shown in their genomic context alongside regulatory/external features and nearby gene models. Key Outputs Union peaks will be exported as output/macs2/&lt;target&gt;/&lt;target&gt;_union_peaks.bed Treatment peaks will be exported as individual bed files for each treatment group (output/macs2/&lt;Ctarget&gt;/&lt;target&gt;_&lt;treat&gt;_treatment_peaks.bed), as well as combined in a single RDS object for faster parsing into an R environment as output/macs2/&lt;target&gt;/&lt;target&gt;_treatment_peaks.rds BigWig files will be generated from the bedgraph files output by mcas2 callpeak using the --SPMR tag, for each individual sample and for each set of peaks called by merging samples from the same group Additional BigWig files will be produced from the bedgraph files output by macs2 bdgcmp, representing fold-enrichment over the input sample for each set of grouped samples 2.3 Differential Signal This step provides much of the uniqueness to the GRAVI workflow combining approaches from macs2(Zhang et al. 2008), qsmooth(Hicks et al. 2018), csaw(Aaron T. L. Lun and Smyth 2014), limma(Ritchie et al. 2015), edgeR(Robinson, McCarthy, and Smyth 2010) and ihw(Ignatiadis et al. 2016) whilst relying heavily on the infrastructure provided by extraChIPs. A sliding window approach as advocated by Lun &amp; Smyth (2014) is the primary strategy used for detection of differetial signal. All two-factor comparisons of interest can specified via the YAML file (Section 5.1) with more complicated layouts specified as below contrasts: - [&quot;control&quot;, &quot;treat1&quot;] - [&quot;control&quot;, &quot;treat2&quot;] Differential signal analysis will be performed for every ChIP target where both treatment groups are found from each specified contrast. Two possible approaches are available, with these being 1) sq-lt (Smooth-Quantile limma-trend) or 2) ls-ql (Library-Size Quasi-Likelihood). Figure 2.2: Overview of steps in the differential signal workflow. Primary R packages used for each step are indicated in brackets. Integration with differential expression results (RNA-Seq) is an option step only performed if RNA-Seq data is provided. Sliding Windows By default, sliding windows will be defined based on the estimated fragment length so that the window size is slightly wider than the fragment length (\\(w_\\text{size}\\)), and the step size is \\(w_\\text{step} = w_\\text{size} / 3\\). This usually leads to window sizes which are multiples of 30nt, e.g. 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240 etc. Alignments are initially counted across autosomes and sex chromosomes, explicitly excluding scaffolds and mitochondrial alignments, as well as regions contained in black/greylists. Windows are discarded if the total number of alignments across all samples are \\(&lt;n\\), where \\(n\\) represents the total number of samples in the current analysis. Windows which are more likely to contain noise than true signal are then discarded using extraChIPs::dualFilter() in combination with the Union peaks from Section 2.2. The set of Union peaks is used as a guide for setting the inclusion/exclusion thresholds which are based on 1) Overall signal intensity and 2) Enrichment over input. Thresholds for each measure are defined such that the proportion \\(q\\) of windows which overlap a Union peak are returned, with windows which pass both inclusion thresholds are returned. This parameter itself is set in config.yml as filter_q as described in Section 5.1. In general, values in the range \\(0.4 &lt; q &lt; 0.6\\) perform well as the sliding windows around the margins of the Union peaks will be discarded at this point. Higher values will lead to large numbers of windows being retained which overlap peak margins and are relatively uninformative. Normalisation Under the sq-lt method, logCPM values are first calculated using the total library size for each sample. These values are then normalised using Smooth Quantile Normalisation(Hicks et al. 2018) specifiying treatment groups as the factor of interest and allowing for normalisation within and between groups. This can be particularly useful in the scenario where a transcription factor (TF) is primarily cytoplasmic in one treatment group, before shifting to the nucleus in response to treatment. Plots showing qsmooth weights, pre/post logCPM, pre/post RLE (Gandolfo and Speed 2018) and pre/post PCA are produced in this section of the workflow. Alternatively, under the ls-ql methodology, only the total library size is provided to the GLM fitting stage with no further normalisation strategies being employed. This is analogous to the default edgeR option provided using DiffBind (Stark and Brown 2011). Hypothesis Testing Given the normalised logCPM values being analysed under the sq-lt approach, an appropriate strategy for detection of differential signal is the limma-trend method (Law et al. 2014) as established for RNA-Seq analysis. Under the ls-ql approach, raw counts are analysed using the Quasi-Likelihood approach for Negative Binomial data (Aaron T. L. Lun, Chen, and Smyth 2016), again as developed for RNA-Seq data, and as offered when using DiffBind (Stark and Brown 2011). Both strategies are performed on all retained windows using a range-based Null Hypothesis (McCarthy and Smyth 2009), such that a minimum change can be specified, below which changes in signal are not considered to be of interest. Under this statistical approach, the Null Hypothesis would be \\[ H_0: -\\lambda \\leq \\mu \\leq \\lambda \\] with the alternate hypothesis being \\[ H_A: |\\mu| &gt; \\lambda \\] By default, the value \\(\\lambda = \\log_2(1.2)\\) is used, which denotes a 20% change in signal as the point where sites become of interest. This value is set in config.yml as the parameter fc (Default: fc = 1.2), and setting fc = 1 would return the statistical approach to be a point-based Null Hypothesis \\(H_0: \\mu = 0\\). After performing this statistical test, overlapping windows are merged taking the individual window with the highest signal as the representative window for the merged region. As this value is independent of the statistical test(Aaron T. L. Lun and Smyth 2014), the resultant set of p-values are FDR-adjusted using the Benajmini-Hochberg approach(Benjamini and Hochberg 1995), giving a set of FDR-adjusted p-values for all merged regions. Independent Hypothesis Weighting The Independent Hypothesis Weighting approach(Ignatiadis et al. 2016) suggests the a set of p-values can be partitioned by any independent variable, with weights assigned to each partition, and these weighted p-values can then be adjusted using conventional strategies, such as the FDR. Under the GRAVI workflow, four possibilities for partitioning the p-values obtained after merging regions are provided, and these can be specified in the ihw parameter of config.yml. The options are ihw: \"targets\" where union peaks from all other ChIP targets included in the larger GRAVI workflow are used to partition p-values. As union peaks are treatment-agnostic, these simply provide a scaffold defining the presence/absence of all other ChIP targets under any treatment condition, in combination across all ChIP targets. ihw: \"regions\" where previously defined genomic regions are used to partition the p-values ihw: \"features\" where any external features supplied are used for the partitioning ihw: \"none\" where no partitioning is performed and the standard FDR-adjusted p-values are used to determine differential signal status The default approach implemented by the IHW authors suggests that p-value partitions must be &gt; 1000, and as such, all the above approaches collapse smaller groups until the smallest group contains at least 1000 p-values (i.e. merged regions). In the case of ChIP targets which do not bind in a promiscuous manner, the IHW step may make minimal difference to the results. Assigning Genes To Windows After merging of neighbouring sliding windows, genes are assigned to each merged region. This is performed using annotated genomic regions, any external features and HiC data, via the function extraChIPs::mapByFeatures(). Under this approach: Regions which overlap a promoter are assigned to the genes associated directly with that promoter Regions which overlap an enhancer are assigned to all genes within 100kb Regions which overlap any HiC interactions are assigned to all genes connected by the interactions Regions with no assignment from steps 1-3 are assigned to all directly overlapping genes, or the nearest gene within 100kb If no HiC data is included, step 3 is not performed Presentation of Key Results The above steps essentially complete the detection of differential signal regions and assignment of these to regulatory target genes. A series of visualisations are then provided including: MA &amp; Volcano plots Profile Heatmaps for sites with Increased/Decreased target signal Results summarised by chromosome Signal/logFC/differential signal partitioned by genomic region If external features are provided, the plots from step 4 are replicated using external features to partition results. A combined summary of the results by genomic region and external features is also included. A series of summary tables, along with the 200 most highly ranked regions are included. Results of differential signal windows and the genes assigned to them are also exported as a CSV for sharing with collaborators. Genomic plots for unique regions based on signal strength (logCPM), changed signal (logFC) and statistical support (FDR) are also provided as part of the default output. Enrichment Testing Using the gene-sets and pathways specified in params.yml four enrichment analyses are performed using goseq(Young et al. 2010). These are Comparison of genes mapped to a site with target signal and genes which are not mapped to a region with target signal Comparison of genes mapped to a differential signal site against genes mapped to a site with detected signal, but which is considered unchanged Comparison of genes mapped to a site with increased signal against genes mapped to a site, but with no differential signal Comparison of genes mapped to a site with decreased signal against genes mapped to a site, but with no differential signal Gene-width is used as an offset for biased sampling in the analysis of bound target only, as longer genes are more likely to have a peak mapped to them. For all other analyses, no offset term is included and the standard Hypergeometric test is performed. All results are presented as searchable, interactive HTML tables including which genes from each pathway are mapped to the relevant set of regions from which signal was detected. Where enough pathways are detected as significantly enriched, network plots are also produced deriving distances between nodes based on shared, differential-signal genes using the overlap coefficient. RNA-Seq Data If results from a differential expression (DE) analysis are included (which can also be microarray results), a series of additional analyses are performed. Firstly, the relationship between detected genes and the genomic regions where target signal has been detected are characterised. If external features are also provided, this is repeated incorporating these features. P-values from DE analysis are partitioned by differential signal status. No further IHW is performed, but this can still provide a clear visual clue as to the relationship between target signal and differential gene expression. Genomic regions for the 5 genes most highly ranked for differential expression, and with \\(&gt;1\\) target-bound window assigned to them are plotted. Given the unpredictability of an RNA-Seq dataset and the number of genes considered to be differentially expressed, bound and differential signal windows are used as gene sets to perform GSEA(Korotkevich, Sukhov, and Sergushichev 2019) using sites directly, and sites partitioned by genomic region and external feature (if provided). GSEA is performed 1) taking direction of differential expression into account, 2) ranking genes purely by significance (i.e. without direction). Finally, standalone GSEA results from the RNA-seq dataset (incorporating direction of change and all requested MSigDB pathways) are compared to enrichment (i.e. goseq) results for differential signal regions. As these are essentially orthogonal viewpoints on gene regulation, P-values from each analysis are combined using Wilkinson’s maximump() method and the resultant set of p-values adjusted using the specified method and requested threshold for \\(\\alpha\\) Any common pathways are given in an interactive HTML table along with network plots based on shared regulatory targets also found in the leading edge fro GSEA. Key Outputs Key output files produced by this step of the workflow are: Differential signal results (by window): output/differential_binding/&lt;target&gt;/&lt;target&gt;_&lt;control&gt;_&lt;treat&gt;_differential_binding.rds Differential signal results (by gene): output/differential_binding/&lt;target&gt;/&lt;target&gt;_&lt;control&gt;_&lt;treat&gt;_differential_binding.csv.gz Regions with increased target signal: output/differential_binding/&lt;target&gt;/&lt;target&gt;_&lt;control&gt;_&lt;treat&gt;_up.bed Regions with decreased target signal: output/differential_binding/&lt;target&gt;/&lt;target&gt;_&lt;control&gt;_&lt;treat&gt;_down.bed 2.4 Pairwise Comparisons By default, pair-wise comparisons are performed between all differential signal results. If ChIP target TF1 has samples in Control and Treat1, whilst ChIP target TF2 has samples in Control, Treat1 and Treat2, with comparisons being requested for Treat1 vs. Control and Treat2 Vs Control, the following pair-wise comparisons will be automatically performed: TF1 (Treat1 Vs Control) and TF2 (Treat1 Vs Control) TF1 (Treat1 Vs Control) and TF2 (Treat2 Vs Control) TF2 (Treat1 Vs Control) and TF2 (Treat2 Vs Control) Given the automated nature of the workflow, this represents the simplest approach and any redundant comparisons are simply able to be ignored by the user. Comparison of Peaks The pair-wise comparisons module initially compares union peaks between the two targets as a Venn Diagram, with the sets of (up to) four treatment-specific peaks being compared using an UpSet plot. Comparison of Differentially Bound Windows Pair-wise comparison of two ChIP targets requires more nuance than simply looking for sites where both are changed. A universal set of windows is first obtained across all windows retained in both targets. These are then classified as either Up, Down, Unchanged or Undetected for each ChIP target. Using both targets, the universal windows are then classified based on both targets. This is particularly important given the hypothesised role of ChIP targets which can act as pioneer factors(Zaret and Carroll 2011), or those which bind in complex and sequester other factors(Hickey et al. 2021). The classification of each window is initially based on significant FDR-adjusted p-value using the range-based H0 in at least one comparison. In order to ensure more accurate assignment of windows in the secondary comparison, the FDR-adjusted p-values using a point-based H0 are used, in conjunction with an estimated logFC beyond the range \\(\\pm\\lambda\\), i.e. \\(|\\widehat{\\text{logFC}}| &gt; \\lambda\\). This reduces the number of regions incorrectly classified as unchanged in one comparison due to the use of the range-based H0, as is common for all situations where threshold are applied. The combined behaviours of both ChIP targets is then compared directly, described by genomic region and external features (if provided). Distances between the windows with representative statistics (i.e. maximal signal) are determined where both targets are present. The combined changes in signal are then compared as a complete set for all windows where both targets are detected, as well as broken down by genomic region and external features. Distances between the windows where the maximal signal was observed are also presented Combined Visualisations Profile heatmaps for all behavioural groups which are detected (e.g. TF1 Up - TF2 Up, TF1 Up - TF2 - Unchanged etc) are all presented. The genomic windows for which the two factors are present are visualised based on the combined strongest signal, and the combined largest change. Using only combinations of Up/Down/Unchanged, six windows for each are presented. As with all genomic visualisations, any coverage provided as an external track (e.g H3K27ac or ATAC-seq signal) will be added to all plots. Enrichment Analysis The same gene-sets from MSigDB(Liberzon et al. 2015) as used previously are then used for enrichment testing, using genes as mapped to windows during previous steps. Enrichment testing again uses goseq with gene length as the biased-sampling term. Enrichment is performed at multiple levels: Genes Mapped To All Windows Genes mapped in either comparison Genes mapped in comparison 1 but not the second comparison Genes mapped in comparison 2 but not the first comparison Genes mapped in both comparisons Genes Mapped to Differential Signal Windows All pair-wise combinations of Up/Down/Unchanged/Undetected are tested across both factors. If no enrichment is found, results are not presented. Where enrichment for pathways are found, network plots are again generated Integration With RNA-Seq Results The set of genes mapped to each pair-wise combination of Up/Down/Unchanged/Undetected are then compared to the external DE results using GSEA incorporating direction of change, and overall significance. Differential expression is displayed as a multi-panel volcano plot, separating genes by detected signal patterns. Along with barcode plots for the 9 most highly-ranked groups, genes in the Leading Edge for all significant combined groups are also provided in the results table, along with network plots. Significantly enriched pathways are again determined by combining p-values from GSEA performed on RNA-Seq and enrichment testing performed sites returning signal, using Wilkinson’s method. 2.4.1 Key Outputs Key output files produced by this step of the workflow include Pairwise differential signal patterns across both comparisons (output/pairwise_comparisons/&lt;target1&gt;_&lt;target2&gt;/&lt;target1&gt;_&lt;comparison1&gt;-&lt;target2&gt;_&lt;comparison2&gt;-pairwise_comparison.csv.gz) The above file as an RDS object for easier parsing into an R environment. If RNA-Seq data is provided, the file output/pairwise_comparisons/&lt;target1&gt;_&lt;target2&gt;/&lt;target1&gt;_&lt;comparison1&gt;-&lt;target2&gt;_&lt;comparison2&gt;-de_genes.csv will contain mappings between DE genes and combined ChIP target differential signal patterns. All lists of enriched pathways will also be exported as csv files.

If using the template repository, as advised, this will be mostly taken care of. The required directory structure is project_home/ ├── analysis ├── config ├── data ├── docs ├── output └── workflow Rmarkdown scripts will be added to and executed from the analysis directory Key configuration files are provided in the config directory Your data should be placed in the data directory as described below The html output summarising all results will be produced in the docs directory Additional output files will be placed in output with all figures written within the respective folder for each html page, or with docs/assets. The workflow itself is run by all code supplied in the workflow directory The complete R Environment for each compiled RMarkdown document is also saved in output/envs, and given their larger sizes, these can be deleted using snakemake --delete-temp-output --cores 1 to conserve storage space. 4.2 Alignments The GRAVI workflow currently takes bam files as the primary input. Multiple workflows exist for quality control, adapter removal and de-duplication and it is assumed that supplied reads will have been pre-processed with the above steps, then aligned to the genome of interest. Files should be placed in the data/bam directory as set in config.yml, although this can be changed if desired. project_home/ └── data └── bam ├── target1_control_rep1.bam ├── target1_control_rep2.bam ├── target1_control_rep3.bam ├── target1_treat_rep1.bam ├── target1_treat_rep2.bam ├── target1_treat_rep3.bam ├── target2_control_rep1.bam ├── target2_control_rep2.bam ├── target2_control_rep3.bam ├── target2_treat_rep1.bam ├── target2_treat_rep2.bam ├── target2_treat_rep3.bam └── input1.bam 4.3 Sample Descriptions The file samples.tsv defines the set of files which the workflow will be applied to. Any files placed in the data/aligned directory, but not specified in this file will be ignored. The desired layout should be a tab-delimited file (i.e. tsv). These can be generated using Excel, Notepad++, R, Visual Studio, or any other software you are comfortable with. A brief example would follow the layout sample target treat replicate input target1_control_rep1 Target1 Control 1 input1 target1_control_rep2 Target1 Control 2 input1 target1_control_rep3 Target1 Control 3 input1 target1_treat_rep1 Target1 Treat1 1 input1 target1_treat_rep2 Target1 Treat1 2 input1 target1_treat_rep3 Target1 Treat1 3 input1 4.3.1 Required columns This file must contain all four of the columns sample, target, treat, input, in any order. If supplied, optional columns such as replicate, passage etc can be referenced in the workflow. As well as defining all required steps for the workflow, labels for plots will be generated from combinations of these columns. sample: This must be identical to the filename, but without the .bam extension. treat: This is used to define all comparisons input: All files must correspond to a file in data/bam but without the .bam suffix. Each sample can have a separate input sample, or input samples can be shared across all or some of the samples. 4.3.2 Optional Columns Any additional columns can be used to denote batches, or passages if running a nested/paired model. These column names will be automatically detected at the appropriate steps of the workflow and incorporated into figures and tables. Common column names may be replicate or passage (for cell lines) 4.4 Additional Files Additional, optional files can also be supplied and is it customary to place these in data/external with paths (relative to project_home) added to config.yml. Full details are demonstrated in Section 5.1 Names can be any informative name chosen by the user. project_home/ └── data ├── bam └── external ├── gencode_annotation.gtf.gz ├── blacklist.bed.gz ├── rnaseq_topTable.tsv ├── external_features.gtf.gz ├── hic_interactions.bedpe ├── additional_coverage_control.bw └── additional_coverage_treat.bw 4.4.1 RNA-Seq Files provided with differential expression analysis results from a relevant RNA-Seq experiment should follow the layout as produced by topTable() from the limma package(Ritchie et al. 2015). Gene IDs should match those in the Gencode GTF (Ensembl IDs) and should be contained in a column called gene_id. Additional expected columns will be logFC and FDR or similar names which could be reasonably found by regex matching within the workflow. 4.4.2 External Features These must be provided as a GTF which can be prepared by any method. The feature types should be defined in a field named feature. Non-overlapping features are optimal but not essential, and this is left to the users discretion. For example, if providing features such as enhancers and super-enhancers(Whyte et al. 2013), it may be more sensible to provide these as mutually exclusive groups. 4.4.3 HiC Interactions Significant interactions can be sourced using any methodology, however these must be provided in bedpe format. 4.4.4 External Coverage Additional coverage files should be provided in bigwig format.

The standard YAML structure is used in all files with the primary objective being passing workflow parameters to the various steps of the workflow. There are four files which control various aspects: config.yml, colours.yml, params.yml and rmarkdown.yml 5.1 The Main Configuration: config.yml This file sets many of the primary parameters and is the file which will need editing for any new dataset. Many settings should remain unchanged as changing default locations of files may lead to unexpected instability in the workflow, whilst other setting should be changed, such as those which determine which comparisons to perform. This is the only file parsed directly by snakemake and subsequent rules, whilst all others are used to pass parameters to R environments. An example layout of config.yml might be: samples: file: &quot;config/samples.tsv&quot; paths: bam: &quot;data/bam&quot; genome: build: &quot;GRCh37&quot; external: blacklist: &quot;data/external/blacklist.bed.gz&quot; gtf: &quot;data/external/gencode.v33lift37.annotation.gtf.gz&quot; rnaseq: &quot;data/external/some_results.tsv&quot; features: &quot;data/external/custom_features.gtf.gz&quot; hic: &quot;data/external/hic_interactions.bedpe&quot; coverage: H3K27Ac: control: &quot;data/external/H3K27Ac_control.bw&quot; treat: &quot;data/external/H3K27Ac_treat.bw&quot; comparisons: method: &#39;sq-lt&#39; fc: 1.2 fdr: 0.05 paired: false filter_q: 0.6 contrasts: - [&quot;control&quot;, &quot;treat&quot;] ihw: &quot;regions&quot; peaks: macs2: gsize: &quot;hs&quot; fdr: 0.05 keep_duplicates: &quot;all&quot; qc: outlier_threshold: 10 allow_zero: true min_prop_reps: 0.5 Settings Which Don’t Need To Be Modified In general, the paths to key files don’t need to be changed and default configurations are well tested. Whilst varying these has been intermittently attempted successfully, unexpected instability may occur and as such, is discouraged. samples: (Default: “config/samples.tsv”) By default, the file which contains all sample-level information is defined as config/samples.tsv. This can be changed to reflect any requirements after inspecting QC reports. paths: bam: (Default: “data/bam”) Alignments should be placed in data/bam as advised in section 4.2, although this can be changed to any other path as desired. Settings Which Should Be Modified genome: Specify the genome build used for alignments and for gene annotations. external: Provide paths to all additional data files here. Only files provided will be included in the workflow. blacklist Should be obtained from here gtf: Should ideally be obtained from Gencode (Optional) rnaseq should be the results as output by limma::topTable() or similar. Gene IDs should match those provided in the Gencode GTF (e.g. Ensembl IDs) and these should be in a column names gene_id. Columns such as logFC and FDR will be searched for during the workflow using regular expressions to find the best match. Can only be in csv or tsv format. Excel-specific (xls, xlsx) formats are not supported. (Optional) features can be determined by any method, with common choices being relevant histone marks, or promoters, enhancers and super-enhancers determined by H3K27ac marks. Features should be non-overlapping with the field feature defining the different feature types. Must be provided in GTF format. (Optional) hic HiC interactions must be provided as a bedpe file (Optional) coverage Tracks provided in this argument will be added to all genomic plots showing binding peaks or differential binding. Multiple files provided within each YAML list element will be overlaid as a single track. There is no upper limit to the number of tracks, however more tracks generally detract from an informative figure. comparisons: These settings determine how the differential binding analysis is performed. method (Default: “sq-lt”) Defines the strategy used for differential binding. The currently implemented options are “sq-lt” and “ls-ql” as described previously fc (Default: 1.2) The setting of 1.2 indicates a 20% change in binding as the threshold below which we are not interested, or below which we consider binding changes to be inconsequential. This parameters is passed to limma::treat() (McCarthy and Smyth 2009) in all differential binding analyses. fdr (Default: 0.05) Windows with significance below this threshold are considered to provide supporting evidence of differential binding. paired (Default: false) If set to true the values in the optional column (e.g. replicate, passage etc.) are used to perform a paired analysis as described in the limma manual filter_q (Default: 0.6) Passed to extraChIPs::dualFilter(). When filtering (i.e. discarding) genomic sliding windows which are unlikely to contain true binding signal, determine thresholds which will retain this proportion of windows which overlap a peak identified by macs2 callpeak. contrasts: Define all contrasts for differential binding. Any ChIP target containing both treatment groups will be included for differential binding. Values must match those in the treat column of samples.tsv. Each differential binding analysis will be performed using the limma-trend method in the context of A vs B, such that complex models are not supported. Use new YAML list elements to define additional contrasts ihw (Default: “regions”) Options used to stratify p-values for Independent Hypothesis Weighting(Ignatiadis et al. 2016) of differential binding results. Can take values \"regions\", \"features\", \"targets\" or \"none\" \"regions\" P-values will be stratified by annotated genomic regions as determined in the initial steps of the workflow \"features\" P-values will be stratified by provided external features \"targets\" P-values will be stratified by the presence of a union peak using all other ChIP targets \"none\" No Independent Hypothesis Weighting will be performed on the results from differential binding peaks: macs2 settings are passed to macs2 callpeak. Only the arguments gsize, fdr and keep_duplicates are accepted. Please see the macs2 manual for more detailed explanations. qc parameters are used for determining if samples are of a high enough quality, and how to determine union/treatment peaks for each target and treatment group. outlier_threshold (Default: 10) As previously described, samples with peak numbers beyond this value relative to the median peak numbers in each treatment group are marked for removal. To ignore this parameter, set this to .inf which effectively sets the threshold to \\(\\infty\\) allow_zero (Default: true) Allow samples with no identified peaks. If a ChIP target is expected to be cytoplasmic in one condition, this can allow samples with no peaks to be retained. min_prop_reps (Default: 0.5) When forming treatment-specific peaks within each target and treatment group, peaks must be represented in at least this proportion of samples. This defaults to 0.5 which would equate to 2 of 3 samples, 2 of 4 samples etc. This value may need to be altered pending the results of a complete run after Quality Assessment has performed. 5.2 Colour Schemes: colours.yml [#colours-yml] Defines all plotting colour schemes for consistency throughout the entire workflow. Colours can be any standard colours able to be interpreted by R, such as 'blue' or '#0000FF'. Recommended YAML list elements are qc, regions, direction and treat. A gradient through al colours provided in the heatmaps element will be generated during generation of heatmaps. Any unspecified colours will be automatically assigned and will propagate through the workflow. As is standard across most programming languages, names are case-sensitive. An example file is given below: qc: pass: &quot;#0571B0&quot; fail: &quot;#CA0020&quot; regions: promoter: &#39;#FF3300&#39; upstream_promoter: &#39;#E1EE05&#39; exon: &#39;#7EDD57&#39; intron: &#39;#006600&#39; proximal_intergenic: &#39;#000066&#39; distal_intergenic: &#39;#551A8B&#39; treat: Input: &quot;#33333380&quot; E2: &quot;#3333CC&quot; E2DHT: &quot;#C52240&quot; features: enhancer: &quot;#FFFF00&quot; no_feature: &quot;#E5E5E5&quot; direction: up: &quot;#CA0020&quot; down: &quot;#0571B0&quot; unchanged: &quot;#7F7F7F&quot; undetected: &quot;#E5E5E5&quot; heatmaps: [&#39;white&#39;, &#39;red&#39;] 5.3 Additional Parameters: params.yml Default settings for defining initial annotations, mapping of peaks to genes and enrichment testing. In general, these will not need to be changed, but can be if required. In particular, the value enh2gene can be set to zero if using data such as H3K27ac HiChIP to determine long-range interactions. For enrichment testing, the preferred p-value adjustment method can be specified using any value that match p.adjust.methods with an appropriate threshold also set in this section. Default settings are relatively inclusive and more stringent setting may be preferred by some users. Parameters for msigdb(Liberzon et al. 2015) are passed to msigdbr(Dolgalev 2022) and fields should match this layout. Any categories passed to gs_cat will lead to all subcategories being used from that category. Specific sub-categories of larger databases can be passed using gs_subcat element. Values which determine the minimum and maximum size of any network plots are also defined here. Node-pair distances above the given distance will be removed from the plot and these edges excluded. gene_regions: promoters: upstream: 1500 downstream: 500 upstream: 5000 intergenic: 10000 ## The values used when mapping peaks to genes. ## Passed to `extraChIPs::mapByFeature()` ## If including H3K27ac HiChIP for long range-interactions, it is advised to ## set `enh2gene` as zero, given that long range interactions in this case ## will more accurately map long-range enhancer interactions than using all ## genes within a given distance mapping: gr2gene: 100000 prom2gene: 0 enh2gene: 100000 gi2gene: 0 enrichment: adj: &quot;fdr&quot; alpha: 0.05 ## Only gene-sets between these two values will be retained before testing min_size: 5 max_size: 1000 ## Only gene-sets above this size will be shown in the results min_sig: 3 ## The categories to use from MSigDB.

The two available fields to supply here are: knitr_opts which are passed to knitr::opts_chunk$set()(Xie 2022) at the beginning of every compiled Rmarkdown document, and rmarkdown_site which determines the layout and style of the final HTML report. All left elements of the navbar are determined automatically during the workflow and will be ignored if supplied here, whilst all other parameters are passed via the file _site.yaml which will be generated during the workflow. Figure height and width parameters must be passed to knitr::opts_set() in inches, and the workflow defaults to svg output for most figures. Some figures which can become excessively large under this setting, such as those with many thousands of overlapping points, are set to always produce png output. Multiple output formats can also be set using values such as ['png', 'pdf'] if preferred. knitr_opts: echo: TRUE message: FALSE warning: FALSE dev: [&quot;png&quot;, &quot;pdf&quot;] fig.align: &quot;center&quot; fig.width: 10 fig.height: 8 rmarkdown_site: name: &quot;GRAVI: Gene Regulatory Analysis&quot; output_dir: &quot;../docs&quot; navbar: title: &quot;GRAVI&quot; right: - icon: fa-github href: &quot;https://github.com/smped/GRAVI&quot; output: html_document: toc: yes toc_float: yes code_folding: hide self_contained: false theme: sandstone highlight: textmate css: gravi.css includes: after_body: footer.html References "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]
