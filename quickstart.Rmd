# Quick Start Guide {#quick-start}

## Install Snakemake {#snakemake}

You will need a `snakemake` installation to begin. 
Please see [here](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) for help setting this up.
If you are running the pipeline on an HPC and are unsure, please consult with your HPC support team about setting up `snakemake` on your specific cluster.
`Snakemake` itself is in widespread use globally, so they should be able to provide the support you need.

## Create the Directory Structure {#quick-directories}

1. Create a new `github` repository on your account by going to [the github template repository](https://github.com/steveped/GRAVI/generate)
2. Download your new repository to your local server or HPC using `git clone <myrepository>`
3. Place your bam files in the subdirectory `data/aligned` as described in section \@ref(alignments)
    + These should be placed in separate directories for each target, such `data/bam/target1` and `data/bam/target2`
4. Edit `samples.tsv` in the `config` directory as described in section \@ref(sample-descriptions)
5. Modify any parameters in `config/config.yml` 

## Run the Pipeline {#quick-run}

### Run On A Local Server

To run using 16 cores without any queuing system (e.g. on a local machine), enter the following

```
snakemake -p --use-conda --notemp --keep-going --cores 16
```

### Run On An HPC

Please consult with your local support team for their advice running a `snakemake` workflow.
In essence, the above command will need to be provided to your queuing system through the preferred strategy.
